# Intro to Kubernetes (K8S)

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/ is a great place to start!

In short, by chatgpt (with a more precise approach )

### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

### Key Features:

- **Automated Deployment**: Simplifies the deployment of containerized applications.
- **Scaling**: Automatically scales applications up or down based on demand.
- **Self-Healing**: Restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, and kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health checks.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Exposes a container using DNS name or their own IP address; if traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes can load balance and distribute the network traffic.
- **Configuration Management**: Keeps application configurations separate from the underlying infrastructure.

### Why Should I Use Kubernetes?

1. **Scalability**: Automatically scale applications based on demand, making it easier to manage both small and large applications.
2. **Portability**: Abstracts away underlying infrastructure, allowing applications to be easily moved between environments (on-premises, cloud providers, etc.).
3. **Efficiency**: Optimizes resource usage by efficiently allocating containers across nodes.
4. **Continuous Deployment and Rollbacks**: Simplifies rolling out new features and reverting back in case of issues, providing a robust continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) process.
5. **Ecosystem and Community Support**: Wide adoption and extensive support from a large community; numerous tools, plugins, and platforms integrate well with Kubernetes.
6. **Microservices Management**: Especially useful for applications following microservices architecture due to its ability to manage multiple, interdependent services seamlessly.

### Why Should I Not Use Kubernetes?

1. **Complexity**: Can be complex to set up and manage, especially for small projects or teams without dedicated DevOps expertise.
2. **Overhead**: Resource-intensive; Kubernetes clusters require significant computing resources, which might be overkill for simple applications.
3. **Learning Curve**: Steep learning curve, requiring a good understanding of containerization, networking, and cluster management.
4. **Operational Cost**: Managing Kubernetes clusters can be time-consuming and may require specialized tools and personnel, increasing operational costs.
5. **Maintenance**: Regular maintenance and updates are necessary to keep the cluster secure and efficient, adding to administrative overhead.
6. **Not Always Needed**: For simple applications or small teams, the benefits of Kubernetes may not justify its complexity and resource requirements. Sometimes simpler solutions like managed container services or even traditional VM-based deployments are more appropriate.

### Conclusion

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications at scale, offering numerous benefits in terms of scalability, flexibility, and resiliency. However, its complexity and overhead might be a concern for smaller projects or organizations lacking the necessary expertise. Carefully consider your project's requirements and resources before opting for Kubernetes.
